Quantum Compiler, v0.03
http://quantum-compiler.org
29 May 2011

This is a research implementation of a quantum compiler,
initially using the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm
of successive approximation.
It is based on similar compilers by Chris Dawson and Aram Harrow.
Links can be found at the project homepage above.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
LIMITATIONS:

Currently, gate accuracy is limited to about 1e-5 using Fowler
distance, occurring around n=7. This appears to be due to numerical errors.
The basic approximations (initial epsilon nets) are searched by using
a kd-tree data structure, which requires decomposing SU(d) unitarties
to R^{{d^2}-1}. This decomposition fails in numpy/scipy when the
unitary in question is too close to identity. In those cases, the
kd-tree search simply returns the identity, which is what limits
the compiled gate accuracy.

Alternative solutions in the future may include some kind of limited
exhaustive search for very fine epsilon nets whenever this near-identity
case occurs.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
CHANGE NOTES:

v0.01: Initial implementation with working SU(2) example.
v0.02: Added README file, releases script, and working SU(4) example.
v0.03: Fixed NaN ValueError due to decomposing unitaries too close to identity.
       Simplify sequences after every multiplication.
       Eliminates extraneous dagger for self-adjoint operators
         (currently Hadamard and identity in the default gate set)

-----------------------------------------------------------------
REQUIREMENTS:

I've tested this on
	Mac OS X 10.5, python-2.5.4, numpy-1.4.1 from fink
	Linux (Fedora Core 13), python-2.6.4, numpy-1.3.0.

Note that generated files are included in this distribution,
generated on the Mac OS X system above, but they may not be
compatible with your version of Python and numpy.

If it doesn't work (complains about lack of defmatrix module),
then you'll have to wipe those files (in pickles/) and
re-generate them according to the instructions below.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
FILES:

This distribution contains the following top-level directories:
/skc/		The main Solovay-Kitaev Python top-level module
/manage/	Scripts for running maintenance tasks
/pickles/	Generated files (described below)
/scratch/	Sandbox for experimenting with functionality
/releases/	Scripts and directory For generating releases
/tests/		Unit tests

-----------------------------------------------------------------
SETUP:

You will probably need to set your PYTHONPATH to the local directory,
like this bash example:

	export PYTHONPATH=.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
OPERATION:

The compiler operates in the following stages.

1. Generating basic approximations.
2. Building a search tree out of basic approximations.
3. Running the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm for a desired gate
   using the tree of basic approximations as a base case.

How to perform each of these steps is given in more detail below.
with example commands given below for SU(2), that is, for single-qubit gates.

You can perform analogous commands for SU(4), they will just take longer
and you are more likely to run out of memory.

1. GENERATION

Generate the basic approximations (epsilon-0 net) as files on disk to
be read / processed later. This depends on a given instruction set. 
You can view the SU(2) settings used in the pre-packaged example
by viewing the file:

	manage/generate_su2.py

This distribution should already come with generated files for your
convenience, which you can list like this:

Sequences are enumerated in "generations", one generation per file,
where generation x contains all sequences up to x instructions in length
(before simplifying). Naturally, generation 16 is larger than generation
1 because there are many more sequences of length 16 than of length 1.

If you want to regenerate these files from scratch, just wipe out
the old ones and run the generate script again:

	rm pickles/su2/*
	python manage/generate_su2.py

This takes a few minutes, so go read e-mail
or get coffee. Some helpful stats are printed to amuse you if you really
want to watch.

Okay, so now we have generated sequences on disk, ready to be processed
into a tree for efficient nearest-neighbor searching.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
2. SEARCHING

This is combined with actually running the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm in practice,
since it takes longer to build the tree, save it to a file, and then load it
into memory again later. So we just build the tree, reading the generation
files from the previous step, and then run the compiler at the same time.

However, you may be curious about the kdtree we use. Yes, that's right, I said
kd-tree.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kd-tree

I stole the Python implementation in that example, and modified it for use
with unitary operators.

If you want to build a kd-tree and then immediately search for the nearest
neighbor to a random unitary, you can run this script:

	python scratch/scratch_kdtree_su2.py

This is the basic lookup operation done when Solovay-Kitaev bottoms out in
its recursion.

It will show you both the Fowler distance (which discounts any global phase
factor) as well as the more conventional trace distance.

For SU(2) and sequences up to 16 in length in our example,
you will typically get a Fowler distance of about 0.02 to 0.06.
Not great, but workable.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
3. COMPILING

Okay okay, enough chit chat. Time for the main attraction.

	python scratch/sk_dawson_su2.py

This script is so-named because it uses Chris Dawson's group factoring
method for SU(2). For the given example (n=2), you should get an error
of 0.00498 in Fowler distance, which again, is nothing to sneeze at for
two levels of recursion.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
SU(4)

So far, we have only done what Chris and Aram have done in their code,
just much slower and several years later. But wait! Now we will, for
the first time ever, compile an SU(4) unitary using Solovay-Kitaev.

1. Generate: we've already generated SU(4) basic approximations up to
   sequence length = 6, which is good enough for testing purposes.
   If you want to generate them again (this takes a looong time):

	rm -f pickles/su4/*
	python manage/generate_su4.py

2. Build a search tree: again, this is really part of the next step.
   But you can test the basic lookup feature of the kdtree.

	python scratch/scratch_kdtree_su4.py

   This will give you fowler distance errors of about 0.2 - 0.4,
   which isn't great, but we only went to sequence length = 6 after all.

3. Compile: here we do n=4 recursion levels to get fowler distance errors
   of about 3e-7. Pretty good!

	python scratch/sk_dawson_su4.py

-----------------------------------------------------------------
FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

So there is a lot of work to be done to improve the performance of this
implementation. As it is, it would take several hours to run an SU(4)
compilation with sufficient accuracy, and it would probably be infeasible
to run it for SU(8).

Here are the areas I can think of off the top of my head:

* Rewrite it in Cython and static typing to speed this up.
  Really, I kinda regret writing this in Python because it is sooo
  slow, but numpy is very convenient.
  But compared to Aram's and Chris's C++ implementations, it makes
  me cry.
* Profile it to find the slow parts.
* Remove assertions.

As for new functionality, it would be interesting to compare different
group factoring methods, and see whether better convergence occurs for
Aram's SU(2) factoring or Chris's.

Also, we could implement net calculation to determine the epsilon-0 of
our basic approximations (initial net) to see whether it meets the
critical epsilon for Solovay-Kitaev to converge. Right now I am just
winging it.

Of course, generic SU(d) compilation is not that interesting and way too hard.
It would probably be more effective to implement Kitaev's idea of whole
circuit compilation, instead of the single gate compilation presented above.

Alternatively, we could examine what gates are interesting in popular algorithms,
like quantum phase estimation, and then work backwards to optimize our compilers
just for those gates.

Another useful direction is to extend Austin Fowler's work to hand-compile a
universal two qubit fault-tolerant gate (like CNOT) for fault-tolerant gates.

I am currently working on these last two directions, so stay tuned!
Any and all feedback is welcome.
